            QA Engineer who strives to deliver high-quality products and services to clients and users. <br /> 
            I have a strong background in C# and Selenium automation, as well as RESTAPI test automation,
            which enables me to create and execute effective test cases and scenarios. <br /> 
            I am always eager to learn new tools and technologies, and to collaborate with cross-functional 
            teams to ensure the best outcomes.</p>

                <h4>QA Engineer at Cognizant Softvision, Bucharest</h4>
                <p>From May 2021 to September 2023</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manual and automation QA, front-end and back-end.</li>
                    <ul>I developed:

                        <li>UI tests using Selenium with C#;</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I came up with a couple of suggestions of how to improve the code<br>
                        I introduced the graphQL test in the automated tests.<br>
                        Also I created a postman collection to ease the regression testing process as the regression was done manually before.<br>
                        I also helped to mentor and guide 2 new colleagues on automation testing. Later, I was responsible to present the weekly report on automation status forthe team.</p>
                    <ul>Also
                        <li>Performed testing for API using Postman and Swagger (REST and graphQL);</li>

                        <li>Bug reporting.</li>
                    </ul>
